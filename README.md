# ADVERSARIAL_SENSITIVTY

Welcome to the official repository for the research paper "On the Interpretable Adversarial Sensitivity of Iterative Optimizers" by an anonymous author.

To conduct the experiments and analysis described in the paper, follow these steps:

To execute each attack and generate related graphs, run the following command: python main.py with the appropriate flag. The available flags are:
--ista: Performs the attack using the ISTA (Iterative Soft Thresholding Algorithm) method and generates the corresponding graphs.
--admm: Performs the attack using the ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers) method and generates the corresponding graphs.
--beamforming: Performs the attack using the Hybrid Beamforming technique and generates the related graphs.
Each flag corresponds to a different case study presented in the paper.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different settings. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please reach out to us.
