# ADVERSARIAL_SENSITIVTY

This is the official repository for the research paper "On the Interpretable Adversarial Sensitivity of Iterative Optimizers" by Anonymous.

To execute each attack, run the following command: python main.py with the appropriate flag. The available flags are:

--ista: Performs the attack using the ISTA (Iterative Soft Thresholding Algorithm) method.
--admm: Performs the attack using the ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers) method.
--beamforming: Performs the attack upon the Hybrid Beamforming.

Each flag corresponds to a different attack mentioned in the paper.
